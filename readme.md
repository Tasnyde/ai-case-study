# Covariant

## Overview and Origin

* Covariant 

* When was the company incorporated?
Covariant was incorporated in 2017. 

* Who are the founders of the company?
Pieter Abbeel, Peter Chen, Rocky Duan, and Tianhao Zhang

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Covariant initially started off as a company called Embodied Intelligence, with a focus on AI robots. At the time, they did not have a clear focus on what industries or issues they would key in on. After conducting intensive research, the company focused its attention on logistics and manufacturing, particularly the hard task of picking, which is a very physical task involving lots of hand motions. Thus, they developed a robotic picking system.(6,11)

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Covariant is a private firm getting its funding from a variety of sources. These includes Radical Ventures, Index Ventures, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Amplify Partners, Gates Frontier Holdings, AIX Ventures, and Northgate Capital. So far, through these investors, Covariant has received $222 million in funding as of April 2023. (3,11,12)


## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Covariant is attempting to add robotic automation and AI to distribution centers, particularly focused around the process of picking orders. This has typically been a very manual process due the variation in products, which could be in the thousands in a single warehouse. Humans have the ability to handle this variation, but robots have historically not been able to because of both the physical and mental processing involved. Covariant is trying to bridge that gap with their robots and AI driving them. (6) If successful, this could greatly improve both efficiencies and cost. The robots can run longer and faster than human pickers. In addition, error rates could come down significantly, injuries associated with picking could be eliminated, and operating costs could be reduced by driving down payroll.(13)

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Covariant's customer bases is broad, as they focus their attention on companies that have distribution centers, logistics centers, manufacturing facilities, fulfillment centers. 
In terms of size, their customer base runs the range of being large multinational operators to small local firms. Since they are private, it is difficult to identify many of their customers, but the company does show that their products have been deployed throughout the world. However, the companies that they do identify are Obeta, Knapp, ABB, Bastian McKesson, Radial, and GXO, which are all very large firms. (3,9) 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Covariant has a couple of competitive advantages that gives them an advantage over their competitors. First off, they use basic off the shelf hardware for their equipment. However, it is the brains behind their products that make the difference. First, the neural network driving the AI is not specialized. It is adaptive and is a cost savings for the customers. Second, it is essentially, it is single network that can handle any type of SKUs, according to the Pieter Abbeel, one of the founders, in a January 2022 article on the IEEE Spectrum website. (6,11)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Covariant uses technology including the company's proprietary AI platform they call the Covariant Brain, which drives their robotic products. It employs a combination of advanced technologies in their systems, including deep learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision, and AI algorithms.(7,11)

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
The company is in the warehouse and manufacturing automation industry. They are looking at ways to utilize robotics and AI to improve productivity, reduce cost, and improve efficiencies for their customers. (1,13)

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 & 10 years?
Warehouse automation has greatly accelerated over the last 10 years. According to the Peerless Research Group in the November 2021 article in Logistics Management, they found that companies are investing heavily into automation technology such as upgraded warehouse management systems, machine learning, and robotic to drive operational improvements and to remain competitive. 
This has been particularly true since the COVID-19 pandemic. Many companies face labor shortages and want to reduce human contact with their products. Automation has proven to be a solid solution to both challenges. (10,13)

* What are the other major companies in this field?
There are many companies across the globe that trying to compete in the warehouse automation space. Some of the other larger firms include Kiva Systems, Amazon Robotics, Symbotic, Dematic, Honeywell and Knapp. In fact, Kanapp and Covariant have partnered together to roll out their technology. (13)

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Covariant has been successful in securing capital and growing the customer base. The company has recently raised $75 million in Series C funds to meet customer demand for scaled AI robotics deployments. The Covariant Brain is powering a wide range of industrial robots to manage order picking, putwall, sorter induction, and more for companies in various industries with drastically improved efficiency and speed. They are making a difference and disrupting the market.(4)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
There are several metrics that Covariant should be concerned with, to ensure they and their customers are successful. First, they need to consider cost. Not only is the purchase and deployment expensive, but what is the maintenance and repair cost look like. Another key metric is safety. Automation systems need to be safe, but what is the impact of taking humans out of the process and the impact on safety metrics. Automation can eliminate many of the expenses associated with injuries. Third, what is the return on the investment for their customers? Companies want to ensure that whatever the invest in provides the financial benefits they need. Companies need to decide if the investment is worth and ROI is way to measure it. (13)

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Covariant is growing and proving to be successful. They continue to get the capital investments they need as startup to continue to increase their operations. Despite the benefits of the funding, it is probably best to know what their partner is saying. “The deciding factor for having a future-proof warehouse is artificial intelligence. It stretches across all aspects of operation and has completely changed the way business is done,” says Peter Puchwein, Director of Innovation at KNAPP. “We share a close partnership with Covariant, whose innovative power and vision we cherish. Thanks to our joint efforts in offering state-of-the-art AI technology, we ensure that our customers are ahead of the game.” (1,4)

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)
Covariant's products are stationary and not mobile. This works well and is easy to deploy in newer manufacturing plants and distribution centers. However, to make inroads into older buildings, this could require a huge investment by their customers to retrofit their current operation. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
This retrofit adds costs that could make impact a customer's decision to move forward with Covariant or not. At some point, if the firm could use their technology and make it mobile with the ability to move throughout a building, it could provide additional business opportunities. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Covariant would need to combine their technology with Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs). Many AMRs already do similiar work to what Covariant is trying to solve. However, Covariant's products are more dynamic and can handle a large variety of SKUs, that what many existing AMRs cannot do. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
By combining the best of what many AMRs already have with their mobility and what Covariant does with their Covariant Brain, it could certainly prove to be very beneficial. It could provide a scalable and flexible solution where the new product could be utilized in an existing warehouse, without having a large outlay of capital to retrofit it.
